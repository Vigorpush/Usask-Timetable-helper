THINGS WE SHOULD DO
Add button above the schedule to allow navigation between terms

Get rid of the hideous number that shows the number of weeks you have been attending the UofS

Large buttons for navigating the weeks. Kinda like the Google images page



THINGS WE REALLLY WANT TO DO BUT UHHHHH NOT SURE...
Add current time to the schedule kinda like that the iOS calendar app does



THINGS THAT WOUDL BE NICE TO HAVE
Associate classes with icons

Ability to customize your schedule. For example add time for lunch, or bathroom breaks
